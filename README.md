infer-moto3D
============

Internal model of 3D that includes tactile/haptic, motor and sensory systems. 

This is the first version of the project. We hope to model this with a neural network that has multiple 
types of inputs. The output is the haptic signal, which we take to be the teacher signal.

After the model is well trained, it learns to map hand pose and visual data with haptic signals. The hope
is that this will result in an internal model of 3D worlds.
